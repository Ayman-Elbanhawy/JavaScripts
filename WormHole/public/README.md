# WebGL Wormhole Effect

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rainner/pen/zJpYbz](https://codepen.io/rainner/pen/zJpYbz).

This is a WebGL rendered interactive space scene that contains a wormhole that changes color over time with a basic spaceship model that appears to be trying to escape being sucked in by the wormhole. Hovering the mouse over the scene changes the angle, clicking on it will zoom out.
